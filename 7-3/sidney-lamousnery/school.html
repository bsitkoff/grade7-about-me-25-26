<h1>🏫School!🏫</h1>
<p>I have been attending Milton Academy for <strong>8 years</strong> now.</p>
<p>My favorite subjects are Science and English.</p>
<p>Science helps me become more educated about our world and learn how things came to be.</p>
<p>English helps he have a better understanding for interpreting language, and I also love reading.</p>
<p>Because I am so busy with dance and math tutoring, I often opp for intramural sports. This fall, I am participating in Milton Volleyball.</p>
<p>Volleyball is a great sport and was easy for me to learn quickly. It helps me learn to communitcate and build trust within a team. I am glad I chose to try something new.</p>
<p>My favorite grade so far was <strong>5th grade</strong>. I got to go on my first overnight trip with my classmates and learn about living on a farm. This taught me to show more gratitude towards my privileged lifestyle. I also got to be the lead in my first play. This helped to support my public speaking skills in a large audience. I learn a lot skills that shaped me into the person I am today.</p>
<p>School has helped me to build many long lasting relationships with teachers and friends. I have learned a lot throughout my many friendships that stengthen my personality.</p>
<p>At Milton Academy I get to express who I am and teach others about my culture. Overall, Milton is a great school for someone who wants to be a part of a friendly and loving community.</p>
