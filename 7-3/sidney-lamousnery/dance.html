<h1>🩰Dance!🩰</h1>
<p>Dance is a huge part of my life. I've been a dancer since I was two years old.</p>
<p>I currently dance at a cultural arts center, where we learn techniques from many genres of dance.</p>
<p>My favorite style of dance is jazz and ballet. I recently participarted in a summer intensive for the prestigious Boston Ballet School!</p>
<p>This year I got promoted to a higher level with girls from high school. I love all my dance friends, they're like my sister. We are all so close!</p>
<p>I dance for 8 hours weekly (not included extra events, such as shows and recitals). One hour on Wednesday, three on Thursday, and four hours on Friday.</p>
<p>Although, dance is very tiresome and lots of hard work and persistence, it is still my favorite part of the days. I will alway love to dance no matter what!</p>
