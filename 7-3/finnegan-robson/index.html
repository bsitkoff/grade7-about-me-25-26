Cricket is a sport that is played 
all over the world. I really like 
it and it is a big part of my 
life. The object of the game is to 
get everyone on one team out 
before they score many points and 
then you have to score more points 
than them before you get all out. 
It's also really fun to watch. 
It's easy to get because it's so 
popular and played on both 
hemispheres so, no matter what 
time of year it is, there's 
cricket on.

</h2>
I've been interested in geography for a couple of years. Now, I can recognize almost every flag in the world and I know every country in the world. Fun fact: The 30th of December in 2011 didn't exist in Samoa because they changed the date line.

</h2>
I enjoy playing chess with my family and friends. My uncle teaches chess at a school for his job and he has taught me a lot of different hints and tricks in the game. My favourite opening is the French defence or the Queen's gambit. I also learned the Hippopotamus strategy which is tactical, but it's not the best.
