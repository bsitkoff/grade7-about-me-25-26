<h1>Sports!</h1>
<h2>I like to play sports, but I really enjoy the unconventional ones.</h2>

<body>The image above is a picture of my rock climbing shoes, the women's Scarpa Instinct VS. Breaking these shoes in is not a fun task, but once you've had them for a while, they mold to your foot and become amazing.<body>
<h2>Rock climbing</h2>
<body> Rock climbing is my main sport. I have been climbing for 6-7 years (actually!). I am currently on the Comp team at Boston Bouldering Project. Climbing is such a great sport for me, and I love bouldering! <body>
<h2>Ninja Warrior<h2>
<body>Ninja Warrior is one of those sports where if you do it, you have to be really good. Unfortunately for me, most of the kids that I compete against have been doing it for 5 years, while I have only done it for 2. At my last competition, I got 25th out of 30. Still, it is really fun!<body>
<h2>Taekwondo</h2>
<body>I have been doing taekwondo for 4 years, and it has been a wild ride. I am a 1st degree black belt. I have wanted to quit 3 times, but never committed. At some point, it just became part of my identity.<body>
