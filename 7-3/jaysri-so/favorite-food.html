<body>I have three favorite foods:<body>
  <h2>Sushi</h2>
  <body>As I said earlier, sushi is my favorite! I love to go to All You Can Eat sushi restaurants, because it is so fun! My three favorites are spicy salmon, eel avocado, and tuna nigiri. Just thinking about those makes me hungry!<body>
  <h2>Baked Potato</h2>
  <body>I had my first baked potato at farm school in fifth grade, and I loved it! I love potato and cheese combos, and it's even better that you put bacon and sour cream on it! Baked potato is my favorite food that I eat weekly.<body>
  <h2>Mango</h2>
  <body>I have loved mango since I was very young. It is definitely my favorite fruit! I also love to drink mango lassi and eat mango mousse. <body>
