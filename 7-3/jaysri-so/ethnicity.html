 <h2>I am half Indian and half Chinese. I also identify as American.</h2>
<h2>Indian</h2>
<body>My mother is Sindhi, which is a type of Indian. My grandparents were born in what is now Pakistan, during partition. After they came to America, my Grandfather opened a saree business, and had my mom!<body>
<h2>Chinese</h2>
<body>I am also Chinese. I like Chinese food, and I especially love dim sum! I have gone to hot pot once, and I really loved it! While it is true that you are paying to make your own food, it is about the experience, which is the best!<body>
