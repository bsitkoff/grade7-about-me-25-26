⚽Soccer⚽
</h1>
<p1>
I have been playing soccer for 10 years and I enjoy watching soccer and play for South Shore Select,  Milton,  and Milton Academy (As captain for Orange Girls Soccer).
I have played in over 15 tournaments and I have scored multiple goals and assists. </p1>

<p2> But my favorite part about soccer is watching and following the teams I support.
My favorite soccer teams are Manchester City, Barcelona and Crystal Palace.</p2>

<p2>Soccer is a big part of my family and how we connect with each other.
I love watching soccer games on Sunday with my dad and having friendly competitions on who is going to win.</p2>
