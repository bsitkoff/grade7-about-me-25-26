<p>
I have been playing <em> <strong> basketball </strong> </em> for two years competitively. 
And before that I played everyday at my old school Bowen. 
I play for the <em> <strong>ASA Wildcats </em> </strong> and for Milton Academy.</p>

<p>   I also love watching basketball and my favorite team is the Boston Celtics. Also, my favorite basketball player is Steph Curry.</p>

<p>Basketball has been a way for me to connect with people of all different backrounds and find something in common with them.</p>
