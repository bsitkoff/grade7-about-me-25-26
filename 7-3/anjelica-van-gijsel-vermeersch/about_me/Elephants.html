<h1> 🐘Elephants!🐘 </h1>
<h2>I absolutely love elephants of any kind.
     They are such friendly and intelligent creatures!
     I have loved them since a very young age.
     I would always ask for elephant stuffies as presents for Christmas and birthdays, which is why I now have so many of them 🙃🙃🙃.
     When I was seven, I went to Thailand with my family which was really fun!
     We went to a place where you could feed elephants and pet them.
     I loved it because they were really friendly.
     If you have never touched an elephant: their skin feels really rough and hairy.
     They are insanely strong!
     Also, two years ago, I went to Thailand again (a different part) with my dad and my sister.
     It was amazing!
     There, we first went on an elephant ride on land.
     It was very comfortable because there was this little seat and all...
     Later, we also went on another elephant ride, but this time, we were wearing bathing suits because the elephants walked into a lake with us on their back!
     It was so much fun!
     So that is why I love elephants so much, they have been very recurring in my life.</h2>
