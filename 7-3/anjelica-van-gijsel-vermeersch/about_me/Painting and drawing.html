    <h1> 🎨Painting and Drawing!🎨</h1>
    <h2> Ever since I was very little, I enjoyed making art.
   It was something I would do everyday.
   From 5 minute crafts during covid, to paintings that represent death and destruction, I have enjoyed all of it.
   It is hard to find sufficient time to make art and do the things that I love.
   That is why I take an art class at the MFA on Sundays to give myself a given two hours just for art.
   It is one of my favorite things to do.
   It calms me, and makes me forget about all of my problems. </h2>
