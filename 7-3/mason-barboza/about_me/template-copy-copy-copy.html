    <h1> All About My Dad </h1>

    <P> My dad is amazing because he is funny and fun.</p>

    <p> I love my dad because of his personality and his humor. he is very funny it is like he just knows what to say to make someone laugh at the right time. There are so many reasons that I love my dad but that would not fit in the world so I picked something I see a lot.
