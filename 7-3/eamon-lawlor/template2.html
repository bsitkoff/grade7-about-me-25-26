    <h7>Though I don't have many very meaningful photos in <strong>my collection</strong> I still have some moments like these two that came after an unfortunate but still exciting Dexter game. I had been anxious and eventually got carsick. You can probably guess how that ended up. But in the end, pictures hold strong and important memories. They're a way to never forget your most valuable times on this planet.
