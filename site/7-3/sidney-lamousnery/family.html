<h1>👪Family!👪</h1>
<p>An important part of my identity is my family and my culture.</p>
<p>My family is made up of 5 people.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dad</li>
  <li>Mom</li>
  <li>Me (Sid)</li>
  <li>Jordin (Sister)</li>
  <li>Spencer (Brother)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>We always celebrate our holidays together, like Christmas, New Years, and Thanksgiving</p>
<p>We love to travel and see relatives, but also travel around the world and have memorable experiences.</p>
<p>We love to watch movies and cook and bake new things.</p>
<p>My family especially enjoys playing dominos and uno, our favorite competitive games.</p>
<p>The bond between my family will never be broken, I am thankful they are a part of journey to adulthood.</p>
