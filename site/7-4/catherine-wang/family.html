 <h1>BISCUIT<h1>
<p>My family got my dog, Biscuit, last year in Feburary. He's a really small, white Maltese and he's currently almost 1 year old. He loves stuffed animals and chewing on blankets. (PHOTO TAKEN BY ME)

<h3>HERE ARE SOME FUN FACTS ABT. HIM!</h3>

<ul>
    <li>He weighs 5 pounds and is probably going to stay that small. 
    <li>For some reason, he's really scared of cars. 
    <li>My mom loves bringing him to my XC and swim meets. He really likes to see new people and harass them with licks. 
    <li>His birthday is December 20th. 

</ul>
