 <h1> More about me! </h1>
  <h2> By Lyndon chu </h2>
 <p> <strong>A thing about me is that I love squash and it's one of my favorite sports. I've been playing it since I was like five and it has been a blast. </strong><p>
      <h2> Some of the resons it's great!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>It's fast paced!</li>
    <li>It's easy to learn</li>
    <li> you only need 2 people to play</li>
    <li> It's easy to practice alone </li>
</ul>
<p>Personally my expirence with squash has been very positive though I haven't won a tournament yet. I love the sport and am hoping to play number 1 for the middles school team this year and maybe make varsity freshman year but that's a while in the future.</p>
