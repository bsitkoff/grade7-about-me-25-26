    I love to play baseball, soccer, and golf. 
    They all are my favorite sports but sports in general are a big part of my life
</p>
<p>
    Sketching has also been a huge part of my life.
    It has been really fun to just sit down and draw something.
    It also can be very soothing.
</p>
<p>
    Hanging out with my friends is always a really fun option in my free time.
    I really like playing sports with my friends and also just talking with them.
