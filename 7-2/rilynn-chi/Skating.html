  Skating

<h4>
  Background Info
</h4>
  I have been skating since I was three, and I mainly started because my older sister, Eileen, started it too. But after a bit, and after making friends, I realized that I loved it too.<br>
  Over the years, I have done so many different things. I started off by wobbling around on the ice, then turns, then spins, then jumps, and finally, I started doing synchronized skating.

  Synchronized skating
</h4>
  I have been doing that for six years now, and it is something that has made me into who I am. <br>
  I made some of my best friends, and I had some of the best times of my life. <br>
  I began on a team called <a href="https://excelsynchro.org/juvenile-2"> Team Excel</a>. I started on snowplow for one year before covid hit, then I stopped for 2-3 years, and after that, I went to aspire pre-preliminary, and then the next year, I moved up to preliminary. I stayed there for three years, and then moved up to Juvenile, where I am now. The Juvenile team made a collaboration with another organization called Colonial and now, the Juvenile and Novice team is called Boston Fusion.<br>
