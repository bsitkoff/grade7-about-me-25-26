<h4>
  family
</h4>
 
</body>
Family is important to me because they are there for me every day and provide support whenever I need it
<h4>
  Friends
</h4>
Friends are important to me because they are there for me at school, sports, camps, and all the times that my family isn't there. That is why family and friends are important to me.<br>
