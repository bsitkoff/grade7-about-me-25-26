<h4>
  The beginning
</h4>
  
  I started off my music journey with the piano. I began when I was 4. And at 7 years old, I started playing the violin, which was especially hard to learn because of covid. 
  I originally started playing piano because of my sister Eileen. Then, I started playing the violin, because one of our family friends played it and recommended it to us. 
<h4>
  now
</h4>

I quit piano when I was around 9 years old, and now, I am on book 6 of the Suzuki series, which is a set of books full of violin pieces. I also started playing viola because my teacher thought it would be a good skill to learn and I play the viola part in my quartet.<br>
