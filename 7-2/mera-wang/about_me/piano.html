  <h1>Piano</h1>
  <p>I have been playing piano since 4 or 5 years old. From Hot Cross Buns to Sonatas, Etudes, and Nocture, each piece teaches me that however hard the process, you will always be able to acheive your goal. There are times where I am practicing a piece, and I feel that I will never get it, but always, no matter what, it works out how it's supposed to.</p>
