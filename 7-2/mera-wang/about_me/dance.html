  <h1>Dance</h1>
  <p>I have been doing ballet since the age of 5. I have faced many roadblocks in my journey. Whether it's struggling to do the splits with 3 blocks are being unable to memorize the moves, I always, with my friends, work through these challenges. Together, we push each other through the hard times.</p>
