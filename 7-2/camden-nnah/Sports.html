<body>
 2 of the main sports I play is Soccer and Basketball I have been playing both sports since I was at least 5 or 6. I think that I am way better at basketball than soccer but others think differently. Everyone in my family including me likes both sports. My dad has season tickets for the celtics. So we have been to <strong> 100's of games </strong> and we once in a while go to New England Revolutuion games which is fun
