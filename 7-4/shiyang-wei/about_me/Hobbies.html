 <h1> Hobbies: </h1>

 <h3> In my free time, I like playing out with my cat Galaxy 🐱 he always doing something funny and makes me feel relax. I also love listening to music 🎶 especially k-pop and r&b. Drawing is another thing I really enjoy 🎨, it helps me clear my mind and be creative. Adding on to that I also enjoy playing games with my sister.
