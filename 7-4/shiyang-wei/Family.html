  <h3> I’m really close with my family, and I love spending time with them. Even though my dad is in China, whenever I go back or he visits America, we always have a great time playing sports together. I also enjoy traveling with my family and making fun memories in new places. They support me in everything I do, and I’m really thankful to have them in my life. </h3>
