<ul>
  <li> I like to sleep, but usually it can be hard for me to fall asleep, but it's good when my bed's comfy. </li>
  <li> I love eating. I try to expand my taste buds as much as possible. Fun fact, I'm halfway through eating every fruit that exsists. </li>
  <li> I love to travel! Ive been to Maryland, Canada, The Caribbean, NYC, etc. </li>
  <li> My favorite school subjects are Math and French. </li>
  <li> I have been singing since I was 3 years old. </li>
