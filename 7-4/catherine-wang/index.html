<h1>MY SWIM TEAM</h1>
<p>My friends from swim are really important to me. One of our favorite things to do together outside of swim is take pictures together. Below is one of my favorite memories with my friends! (photo taken by Hazel on my phone)

<ul> 

   <li>This picture is of Hazel, me, Fiona, Louise and Skye (in the order of the picture) after an open water swim at Crimson's team picnic.
