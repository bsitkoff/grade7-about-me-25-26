<h2>I also like xc. some reasons why:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> It is really fun to run with your team.</li>
  <li> You can strengthen yourself for almost every sport you use your arms, legs and torso.</li>
  <li> You get to go to these really awesome meeets against other teams, and there usually in the woods so you get to be around nature as well!</li>
</ul>
