<h1>All about me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Clark Downey.</p> <p>I am a student at Milton Academy, a school in Milton, Massachusetts. I've lived in Milton my whole life and gone to Milton Academy since Kindergarden. Fun fact! when I was really young I went to Milton Academy Daycare, so basically Milton has been in my life since I was a baby!</p> <p>My family consists of my mom, my dad, and my brother Reid. I love hanging out with my family and doing things with them. Including traveling, going out to dinner, or just playing a board game! Some things I like to do for hobbies are: Reading, Legos,  video games (Minecraft, all Mario kart realated things, and Super Smash Bros ). as well as sports, Star Wars, and Friends! My Favorite food is probably sushi, kiwi. Or pepperoni and pineapple pizza. I don't know where this thing started! Pineapple is great on pizza!</p>

  <p>This is me in Switzerland standing on a big rock:</p>
