<h3>I play chess, drums, and I do robotics. I love all of them</h3>
<ul>
<p> I love playing chess because it's all about strategy and it feels so good after you win a tough match</p>    
<p> I love playing drums but my parents didn't want me to because they thought it was going to be too loud but they thought wrong.</p>

I started getting into robotics because of my brothers in 5th grade. I liked it so I stuck with it.</ul>
