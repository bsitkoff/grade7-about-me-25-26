    <h3>Verse 1</h3>
    <p>
        You used to get it in your fishnets<p>Now you only get it in your nightdress</p><p>Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness</p><p>Landed in a very common crisis</p>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p class="chorus">
        Where did you go?<p>Where did you go?</p><p>Where did you go?</p>

<br>
        <br>
        
    </p>
    
    <h3>Verse 2</h3>
    <p>
        <p>You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</p>
<p>Just sounding it out</p>
<p>But you're not coming back again</p>
<p>You're falling about</p>
<p>You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</p>
<p>You were just sounding it out</p>
<p> you're not comin' back again</p>
<p>You used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)</p>
<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p>Now you only get it in your nightdress</p>
<p> all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)</p>
<p>Landed in a very common crisis</p>
<p>Everything's in order in a black hole (you were just sounding it out)</p>
<p>Is anything as pretty in the past, though?</p>
<p>That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco (you're not coming back again)</p>
<p>Remember when you used to be a rascal, oh?</p>
    </p>
